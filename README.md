# Optimization: Using Genetic Algorithm to solve Hill Climbing Problem

A genetic algorithm to find the global optimal solution via a path on a 3D surface terrain.

The hill climbing algorithm was provided by a Minerva Assignment (until 3D plot), while I coded the genetic algorithm in the second part.
